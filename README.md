# gradebook_app
# Project Overview
This is the second project under the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

The application consists of four functions, each representing a different step:

Step 1: Compute Average Score
A function to compute the average of class scores from an array called scores. The function takes an array as an argument and returns the average of the scores.

Step 2: Grade Representation
A function that returns a string representing a student's grade (from A++ to F) based on their score (0 to 100).

Step 3: Check Passing Grade
A function that checks whether a student has a passing grade. A passing grade is defined as any grade that is NOT an "F".

Step 4: Pass/Fail Message
A function that prints a message to the student indicating whether or not they passed, based on the return value of the previous function.
