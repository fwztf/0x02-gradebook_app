# gradebook_app
The second project under the FCC JS algorithms and data structures curriculum

the app is a combination of 4 different functions, marked from steps 1 - 4

step 1:
a function to compute the average of class scores from an array "scores"
the function takes in an array as an argument and returns the average of 
scores in it

step 2:
a function that returns a string that represents a student's grade (A++ to F)
based on their score (0 to 100)

step 3:
a function that checks whether or not a student has a passing grade. A passing
grade is defined as any grade that is NOT an "F"

step 4:
a function that prints a message to the student whether or not they passed,
based on the return value of the previous function
