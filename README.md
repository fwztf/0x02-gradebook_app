# gradebook_app
## Project Overview
The application consists of four functions, each representing a different step:

## Functions
### getAverage(scores)
- computes the average class score from an array called scores.
- takes an array as an argument and returns the average of the scores.

### getGrade(score)
- returns a string representing a student's grade (from A++ to F) based on their score (0 to 100).

### hasPassingGrade(score)
- checks whether a student has a passing grade. A passing grade is defined as any grade that is NOT an "F".

### studentMsg(totalScores, studentScore)
- prints a message to the student indicating whether or not they passed, based on the return value of **"hasPassingGrade(score)"**.
